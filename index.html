<p>Evade is a simple game about evading the enemies. It is a fast paced arcade game where low precision is key to getting a high score. You can get coins and buy skins with them, they come in all shapes and sizes and we have a big variety of them . The game challenges the players by spawning more and more enemies, turning a simple concept into one that is hard to master. Evade is coming to iOS and you can find it in Gamejolt for free.</p>
